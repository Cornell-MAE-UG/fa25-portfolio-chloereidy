### Project Overview
As part of Cornell University’s MAE 4272 Fluids and Heat Transfer Laboratory, our team designed, fabricated, and tested a small-scale wind turbine blade operating at low Reynolds numbers. The goal was to improve power output relative to a baseline blade while meeting strict geometric, structural, and wind tunnel constraints. The blade was designed for a most-probable wind speed of 5 m/s based on a Weibull distribution and a target tip-speed ratio of 6, corresponding to a design rotational speed of approximately 1880 RPM.

### Design Process
The blade design was guided by aerodynamic efficiency, manufacturability, and structural safety. We selected the SG6043 airfoil for its favorable lift-to-drag performance at low Reynolds numbers and reliable 3D printability. Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory was used to determine spanwise chord and twist distributions, which were iterated to improve bending safety factors while preserving aerodynamic performance. Structural checks confirmed that stresses remained within material limits under expected operating conditions.

### Experimental Testing
Experimental testing was conducted in a closed-loop wind tunnel using a magnetic particle brake to control torque and rotational speed. Power curves were measured across wind speeds from 3 to 5.5 m/s, focusing on operating conditions most likely to occur based on the Weibull distribution. While measured power output was lower than theoretical predictions due to unmodeled losses such as tip effects and induction, the final blade consistently outperformed the baseline design and exhibited no structural damage during testing.

### My Contribution
I contributed to airfoil selection, research into the aerodynamic theory underlying the BEM model, and analysis of experimental results. I was responsible for developing the experimental testing protocol, selecting test conditions using the Weibull wind speed distribution, and estimating expected power output and annual energy production from measured data.
