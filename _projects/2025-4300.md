## Boeing 737 Max Failure Analysis

The Boeing 737 MAX disasters illustrate how engineering failures often arise not from a single technical flaw, but from the interaction of design choices, organizational pressure, and ethical judgment. Although the immediate cause of the crashes was the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), the deeper failure stemmed from a series of decisions that prioritized cost, speed, and competition over transparency and public safety. Together, these decisions created conditions in which a known safety risk was allowed to persist.

MCAS was introduced to compensate for aerodynamic changes caused by larger engines mounted farther forward on the 737 MAX. The system automatically adjusted the aircraft’s horizontal stabilizer using input from a single angle-of-attack sensor, creating a critical single point of failure. If faulty data was received, MCAS could repeatedly command nose-down movements, even when pilots attempted to correct the aircraft. Because the system reset after pilot input, it could re-engage without clear warning, significantly altering aircraft behavior while limiting pilot awareness and control.

These technical risks were intensified by individual and organizational decisions surrounding MCAS implementation. Boeing chose not to clearly disclose MCAS to pilots and resisted simulator training requirements in order to preserve commonality with earlier 737 models. Internal communications and post-accident investigations indicate that MCAS was underrepresented to regulators and airline customers, while simulation issues and early warning signs were not adequately addressed. At the same time, Boeing faced intense pressure to compete with Airbus’s A320neo and to meet aggressive delivery timelines, encouraging rapid certification and minimal design changes despite unresolved safety concerns.

Despite extensive investigations, important facts remain unclear. It is not fully known how explicitly Boeing engineers communicated MCAS risks to senior management, how those concerns were evaluated, or how closely Boeing executives coordinated with FAA regulators during certification. It is also uncertain whether junior engineers felt able to raise objections within Boeing’s hierarchical culture. Based on available evidence, it is reasonable to assume that safety concerns were raised but deprioritized due to cost, schedule, and competitive pressures.

Ethical disagreement in this case is shaped by conflicting definitions of safety, accountability, risk, and transparency. Boeing’s actions suggest a compliance-based definition of safety, where meeting regulatory requirements is treated as sufficient. In contrast, victims’ families define safety in terms of preventing foreseeable harm to human life. The FAA relies on enforceable standards and delegated authority, creating a gap between formal compliance and ethical responsibility. These differing definitions significantly affect ethical judgment, as actions that may satisfy legal standards become ethically unacceptable when evaluated through their human consequences.

When evaluated using established engineering codes of ethics, particularly the ASME Code of Ethics, the failures in this case become clearer. ASME Canon 1 requires engineers to “hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.” In the 737 MAX program, this obligation conflicted with organizational loyalty and competitive pressure. Certification engineers approved MCAS despite its reliance on a single sensor and its ability to override pilot input, violating the principle that public safety must take precedence over employer interests. ASME Canon 3 further requires engineers to issue public statements in an objective and truthful manner, yet critical information about MCAS was withheld from pilots and inadequately disclosed to regulators.

ASME Canon 4, which emphasizes acting as faithful agents of employers while avoiding deceptive acts, does not override the duty to protect the public. In this case, prioritizing loyalty to Boeing and compliance with internal objectives conflicted directly with Canon 1. Ethical hierarchy therefore applies: the obligation to protect public safety outweighs obligations to employers or clients. Continuing operations after simulations and the first crash revealed serious flaws further violated this ethical hierarchy.

At the same time, engineers and regulators operated under significant constraints. Boeing’s hierarchical structure discouraged dissent, regulatory delegation blurred accountability, and limited system-wide visibility made it difficult for individuals to fully assess MCAS risks. These constraints help explain, though do not excuse, why ethical action was delayed.

The MCAS failures could have been prevented through changes at multiple levels. Engineers must be empowered to escalate safety concerns without fear of retaliation, organizations must insulate safety decisions from financial pressure, and regulators must strengthen independent oversight and transparency requirements. Most importantly, ethical engineering must extend beyond regulatory compliance to include proactive responsibility for foreseeable harm.

Ultimately, the Boeing 737 MAX case demonstrates that ethical engineering is not solely a technical or legal exercise. It requires judgment, transparency, and a commitment to public safety that overrides competitive and financial incentives. When these responsibilities are neglected, the consequences are irreversible, measured not only in institutional failure but in human lives lost.
